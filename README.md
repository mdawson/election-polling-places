# election-polling-places

The Election Polling Places application is a configuration of ArcGIS Server and a HTML 5 / JavaScript application that helps citizens locate their election polling place, comment on conditions at the polling place, and obtain information about current elected officials. It is a single application that can be deployed by local governments and used citizens on a desktop PC, mobile phone, and tablet device. It is typically used by citizens during an election season, but can be used throughout the year to determine which elected official represents the precinct they reside in.
